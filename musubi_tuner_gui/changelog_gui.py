        """
**🎬🔊 Full MiniMax H3 text-to-video-with-audio (T2VA), first/last-frame (FL2VA), and reference-to-video (Ref2VA) LoRA training.**

- **New "Krea 2 Checkpoint Merger" tab**: blend two complete ConvRot INT8 Krea 2 DiT checkpoints at any ratio. The memory-bounded workflow validates matching tensor and quantization layouts, dequantizes one layer at a time, blends in FP32, requantizes with the original per-layer ConvRot group size, and writes a portable ComfyUI / SwarmUI-compatible checkpoint with CPU/CUDA modes and cancellation.
- **New "MiniMax H3 Video Training" tab**: complete pipeline from dataset TOML generation (17n+5 frame rule, 24 fps timestamp normalization, and the hard batch-size-1 rule handled automatically) through video+audio VAE latent caching and Qwen3-VL 32B text-embedding caching to LoRA training with `networks.lora_minimax_h3` — all chained from one Start Training button.
- **Joint audio supervision**: clips with a real audio track (or a same-stem `.wav` sidecar) train the audio stream too; silent clips are never supervised toward silence. The cache reports the supervised-audio fraction, and `video_only` / `audio_loss_weight` controls are exposed.
- **Guidance-distillation countermeasure enabled by default** (scale 4.0, sigma-min gate 0.15): H3 checkpoints are CFG-distilled and plain flow training slowly washes them out; the guidance loss re-anchors the target in the distilled space. The required uncond probe cache is generated automatically during text-encoder caching — nothing to configure.
- **Teacher matching mode** (t2va) with **two teachers**: the FL2VA endpoint teacher (`first,last` — conditioned on the real first/last frames; the tab automatically builds the FL2VA latent caches and dual-presentation text caches it needs) and the new **reference teacher** (`ref` — the frozen base copies the training clip itself via the Ref2VA layout: complete information at every sigma, a 3-5x lower teaching-band floor, and **audio becomes a real teaching target**). Sigma-max band protection, DC/magnitude loss shaping, and timestep-focus controls are exposed for both.
- **Consumer-GPU memory stack**: pruned ConvRot INT8 transformer (≈21 GB, auto-detected — no flags), NVFP4+AWQ text encoder (≈15.7 GB) streamed layer-by-layer from CPU (`text_encoder_blocks_to_swap`, 50 = minimum VRAM), H2D-only block swap of up to 48/50 DiT blocks, and on-the-fly `convrot_int8` / `prune_adaln` for full BF16 checkpoints. FP8 is not supported by H3 and is blocked with a clear error.
- **Model downloader**: new "MiniMax H3 Training Models (Low VRAM)" bundle (≈42.5 GB total, public Comfy-Org repo, no login), plus optional higher-quality ConvRot INT8 text encoder and Ref2VA transformer entries.
- **Demo presets** (both rank-128 LoRA @ LR 1e-4, AdamW8bit, guidance loss 4.0): `MiniMax_H3_LoRA_Demo_24GB.toml` (384px @ 124 frames, H2D swap 40 — measured 22.5 GB peak and ≈24 s/it on an RTX 3090) and `MiniMax_H3_LoRA_Demo_Lowest_VRAM.toml` (256px @ 124 frames, H2D swap 48 ring 1 — ≈8.5 s/it on an RTX 5090).
- **Backend**: merged the complete upstream `feat-h3-teacher-matching` branch (40+ commits: H3 transformer/VAEs/text encoder, packing, dual flow schedules, ConvRot INT8 + NVFP4 support, TE layer streaming, guidance loss, teacher matching) into our musubi-tuner fork while keeping every existing model family unchanged — 758 backend and 201 GUI tests green.

        "V32.1 — 2 August 2026 — Dataset Repeat-Count Safety + Notifications",
        """
**📁 The dataset TOML generator now tells you when a dataset folder is missing the repeat-count prefix instead of silently counting it once.**

- Dataset folders are expected to be named `N_name` (e.g. `5_ohwx` = 5 repeats of concept `ohwx` per epoch). If you forget the `N_` prefix, the folder still trains: the repeat count **defaults to 1 and the generator now shows an `[INFO]` message** telling you the prefix was forgotten, that the folder was counted as 1 repeat, and how to rename it to set repeats explicitly.
- A repeat count of `0` (e.g. `0_ohwx`) would make the trainer skip that dataset entirely, so it is now **clamped to 1 repeat with a `[WARNING]`** instead of writing `num_repeats = 0` into the TOML.
- Ambiguous number-only folder names (e.g. `5` or `5_`) are detected and counted as 1 repeat with a clear explanation.
- Every generated dataset now reports its final repeat count in the status output (`[OK] Added ... with num_repeats=N`), so you can verify repeats at a glance before training.
- Applies to **every training tab** that generates dataset TOMLs from folder structures (Qwen, WAN, LTX-2, FLUX, FLUX.2, Z Image, Krea 2, Ideogram 4, FLUX Klein, ...). Folder-name caption generation is unchanged and now shares one robust parser everywhere, with new automated tests covering the edge cases.

**🎬 Full LTX-2 / LTX-2.3 text-to-video and audio-video LoRA training with INT8 ConvRot quantization.**

- **New "LTX 2.3 Video Training" tab** supporting both LTX-2 (19B) and LTX-2.3 (22B) checkpoints (`--ltx_version` selector with automatic checkpoint version detection).
- **Complete video training pipeline**: dataset TOML generation from folder structures (videos and images, 8k+1 frame rule and 25 FPS resampling handled automatically), VAE latent caching, Gemma 3 12B text-encoder output caching, and LoRA training with `networks.lora_ltx2` — all chained from a single Start Training button.
- **INT8 ConvRot quantized training** for the 22B base model: group-wise Hadamard rotation + per-row MSE-clipped INT8 (≈41 dB weight SQNR vs ≈32 dB for scaled FP8), selectable group size, optional per-layer quality report JSON, and support for pre-quantized INT8 ConvRot checkpoints produced by `ltx2_quantize_int8_convrot.py`.
- **Additional base quantizations**: Scaled FP8 (with keep-blocks list and optional W8A8 activations) and NF4, plus block swap up to 47 blocks, H2D-only block swap, blockwise checkpointing, and low main-RAM loading for large-model training on consumer GPUs.
- **Audio-video (av) and audio-only training modes** with separate audio buckets and selectable audio source (video container or external .wav files).
- **Video sample generation during training** with tiled VAE decoding, CPU offloading, LTX-2.3 sampling presets, and optional audio merge into the preview mp4.
- **Model downloader**: new "LTX 2.3 Training Models" bundle (LTX-2.3 22B dev checkpoint + Gemma 3 12B FP8 single-file text encoder, ~59 GB total, no gated repos - no login needed).
- **Demo preset**: `LTX_2.3_LoRA_Demo.toml` — rank 128 LoRA with INT8 ConvRot, tuned for 24-32 GB GPUs.
- Merged the complete LTX-2 backend into our musubi-tuner fork: 60+ new LTX-2 modules including quantizers, LoRA merge/extract/convert utilities, IC-LoRA and conditioning systems, and audio-video joint training — while keeping every existing model family (Qwen, Wan, FLUX, Z Image, Ideogram 4, Krea 2, Hunyuan, FramePack...) unchanged and fully working.

        """
**⚡ A faster, more accurate alternative to Scaled FP8 for Krea 2 LoRA training — and it finally makes Krea 2 fast on RTX 30 series and older GPUs.**

- **Krea 2 INT8 ConvRot training implemented** (integrated musubi-tuner pull request #1008, [arXiv:2512.03673](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03673)).
  - It adds a **third base-weight mode** for Krea 2 LoRA training, alongside BF16 and Scaled FP8. The frozen DiT base weights are quantized to INT8 *after a block-diagonal Hadamard rotation that makes them easy to quantize*, and the forward pass then runs a real fused Triton INT8 matmul instead of dequantizing back to BF16.
- **New "ConvRot INT8" checkbox** in the Krea 2 LoRA tab's Model Settings. It replaces FP8 Base + Scaled FP8 (the two cannot be combined — the GUI rejects the combination).
- **New "ConvRot INT8 Backward" dropdown**: `bf16` (default, most accurate) or `int8` (faster gradients, slightly quantized).
- **Same VRAM as FP8** (1 byte per base weight, half of BF16) but roughly **2.5x faster Linear forward than BF16 and 2.7x faster than Scaled FP8** — up to 1.5x faster overall training with no quality loss.
- **Better numerical accuracy than block-wise Scaled FP8** — measured output relative error against the BF16 reference is about 1.4e-2 for ConvRot INT8 vs about 2.5e-2 for Scaled FP8. According to our tests INT8 ConvRot tracks BF16 training more closely than FP8 Scaled does (all runs correlate with the reference at r ≥ 0.9997).
- Works with block swap, gradient checkpointing, and torch.compile. Requires `triton` on Linux / `triton-windows` on Windows — both already installed by this application's requirements.
- Demo configs updated / added for the new INT8 ConvRot training: `Krea_2_LoRA_Demo.toml` (updated) and `Krea_2_LoRA_Demo_High_VRAM.toml` (new).
- Krea 2 made its Hugging Face repo gated after it was added to the downloader, which broke downloads — **fixed** in the latest zip file.
- Some minor bug fixes, improved CMD output to prevent confusion, and improved error reporting.

  - The system probing of CUDA and C++ toolchain elements used to run at every training start, slowing down initialization. It is now **cached for 30 days** (a fresh install into a new folder re-caches).
  - If Torch Compile fails for any reason, training still works via automatic fallback.

- INT8 Row ConvRot HQ is better than GGUF Q8 quality and **more than 100% faster on RTX 3000, 4000 and 5000 series**.
- Krea 2 measurements: INT8 Row ConvRot is **96.2% similar to BF16** while GGUF Q8 is only 90.0%, FP8 Scaled 82.2% and NVFP4 63.7%.
  - INT8 Row ConvRot generates in 3.05 s → **1.82x faster than BF16** (5.56 s). NVFP4 takes 3.8 s (1.46x faster), GGUF Q8 takes 6.06 s (~8.3% slower than BF16).
- LTX 2.3: INT8 Row ConvRot HQ is **100% faster than FP8 Scaled and 50% faster than BF16** on RTX 5090, with quality almost identical to BF16.

  - Support LoRA and full Fine-Tuning / DreamBooth, block swapping, checkpoint resume, and low-precision training.
  - Automatic fused/non-fused selection where supported; unsafe combinations are rejected before training; detailed optimizer-specific guidance in the GUI.
- **Guarded Windows SDPA acceleration:** native PyTorch fused SDPA is preferred; external FlashAttention is used only after passing real CUDA forward/backward compatibility tests; automatic fallback to working PyTorch SDPA. Every training tab has a "Use Legacy PyTorch SDPA" compatibility switch.
- Smarter torch.compile with block swapping.
- Improved handling of empty or missing Accelerate launch values; hardened Qwen and Z-Image full-model configuration previews and runtime exports; correct full-fine-tuning metadata written to Qwen and Z-Image checkpoints.
- New gradient statistics (including maximum absolute gradient) measured before clipping and sent to TensorBoard / Weights & Biases.

- **Auto model-path detection:** when you load a config, the app checks whether it has valid model paths; if not, it scans the default model-downloader paths and auto-fills them. Works on Windows, Linux and Cloud.
- Download multiple models at once with comma separation or ranges, e.g. `1,2,3` or `1-3,5`.
- Model Quantizer tab completely improved with newer presets. INT8 ConvRot Learned (Best Quality / Slow) preset recommended — better than GGUF Q8 quality and 2x faster on all GPUs. ComfyUI and SwarmUI fully support INT8 Row ConvRot.
